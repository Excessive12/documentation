# Command line interface

The Homarr image ships with a built-in recovery tool. This can be useful, if you do not have access to Homarr or if something is not working.
Please note that the CLI is an *emergency tool*, not an API tool.

:::caution

Using the recovery CLi tool can cause problems when requests are being sent to Homarr while the tool is running. \
You should also create a backup of the database, in case you break something.

:::

## Execute CLI with Docker

1. Execute ``docker ps | grep homarr`` on the root system with Docker to find the container ID of your Homarr container.
2. Run ``docker exec -it <container-id> /bin/bash homarr <your-command-goes-here>``. \
Replace ``<container-id>`` with your container ID from step 1. \
Replace ``<your-command-goes-here>`` with the command you want to execute (see sub-pages).
