We'd like to let you know that we've updated our documentation and reorganized the pages.
This means, that some links may no longer be valid - we apologise if this causes any inconvenience for you.

A few highlights include:

- Updated navigation bar for much easier navigation
- Improvements to the landing page
- Completely revamped [about us page.](/about-us)
- Bug fixes for image zoom
- Added documentation for management pages and [new CLI tool](/docs/advanced/command-line/password-recovery/)

Please [let us know](/docs/community/get-in-touch) is something is not working as expected.
